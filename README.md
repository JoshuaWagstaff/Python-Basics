# Writeup
# # Python-Basics

## Objective
The goal of the Python Basics lab was to build and reinforce core scripting skills by walking through a series of hands-on exercises in Python

Print statements 

Arithmetic operations 

Variables

Conditional logic in a shipping-cost calculator 

Loops 

Functions and alerts in a Bitcoin-value notifier 

File I/O to read a flag file 

By stringing these fundamentals together—culminating in two mini-apps (a shipping calculator and a Bitcoin alert script)—I reinforced the core Python techniques that underpin automated telemetry generation and detection logic in SIEM-based Detection Labs.

### Skills Learned

Print Statements & String Formatting: Displaying text and variables to the console.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation.

Variables & Data Assignment: Creating and updating named storage (e.g., height, basket cost).

Conditional Logic: Using if/else to implement rules (e.g., shipping-cost calculator).

Loops: Writing for and while loops to iterate over ranges and collections.

Functions: Defining reusable blocks of code to encapsulate logic (e.g., Bitcoin alert function).

File I/O: Opening, reading, and processing file contents to extract flags or data.

Basic Scripting for Automation: Combining the above concepts into mini-apps (shipping calculator, price alert) that mirror telemetry-generation and detection tasks in a SIEM context.

### Tools Used

Python 3.x — The core interpreter for running all scripts and exercises.

requests library — Used in the Bitcoin-value alert script to fetch live price data via HTTP.

Code Editor (e.g., VS Code) — Writing, editing, and debugging Python files.

Terminal / Command Prompt — Launching scripts, viewing output, and navigating the filesystem.

TryHackMe Platform — Hosted the Python Basics room and provided the challenge prompts.
